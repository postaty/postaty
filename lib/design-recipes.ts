    id: "fa-editorial-split",
    name: "Magazine Editorial Split",
    category: "fashion",
    directive: `Concept: Vertical asymmetric split — narrow left column in solid black with vertical white text (collection name or season), wide right section with the product/model image filling the space. A thin white line separates the columns. Small brand logo at bottom-left, price or CTA at bottom-right in clean white text on a translucent dark bar.
Creative hook: The asymmetric split mimics high-fashion magazine layouts. The vertical text on the narrow panel creates intrigue and forces the viewer to tilt their head — a classic editorial trick. Ultra-clean typography, no decorative elements.
Mood: Editorial, high-fashion, magazine-quality, sophisticated.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Left column becomes deep navy with gold vertical text. Add a thin gold accent line. Subtle crescent at the top of the narrow column.`,
      eid: `Left column stays black but text becomes warm gold. Small gold dot decorations along the dividing line. Celebratory yet refined.`,
    },
  },
  {
    id: "fa-blush-minimal",
    name: "Soft Blush Minimalist",
    category: "fashion",
    directive: `Concept: Warm blush pink canvas with the product/model as the dominant central element, taking up 60-70% of the space. Ultra-thin serif headline in dark charcoal at the very top. Small, refined price text with a thin underline. Organic soft shadow beneath the product. No borders, no frames — just the product breathing in pink space.
Creative hook: The blush pink creates a soft, feminine runway feel. The extreme minimalism lets the product speak entirely for itself. Tiny dot accents (3-4 small circles) in mauve near one corner as the only decoration.
Mood: Soft, feminine, editorial, runway-ready.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Blush becomes warm champagne/cream. Headline in deep burgundy with a thin gold underline. Small gold crescent near the dot accents.`,
      eid: `Blush stays. Dot accents become gold. Add a single line of "عيد مبارك" in elegant thin serif below the price.`,
    },
  },
  {
    id: "fa-dark-luxury",
    name: "Dark Luxury Showcase",
    category: "fashion",
    directive: `Concept: Matte black background with the product lit dramatically — a single spotlight effect creating a bright focal point surrounded by darkness. Headline in white condensed uppercase tracking wide. A slim metallic silver or platinum accent line below the headline. Price in a small, refined pill shape.
Creative hook: The spotlight-in-darkness technique creates a high-end boutique window display feel. The wide letter-spacing on the headline suggests luxury brands. Everything is restrained — darkness does the heavy lifting. Optional: faint smoke/mist gradient at the bottom.
Mood: Luxurious, dark, boutique, high-end.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Silver accents become gold. Add a faint gold geometric pattern overlay at extremely low opacity. Small crescent integrated into the accent line.`,
      eid: `Gold accents throughout. Small gold sparkle dots scattered in the dark space around the product. Festive yet dark and premium.`,
    },

  {
    id: "fa-collection-grid",
    name: "Collection Grid Layout",
    category: "fashion",
    directive: `Concept: Off-white canvas divided into a grid — one large feature cell (taking 2/3 of the space) with the hero product, and 2-3 smaller cells showing additional items or color variants. Thin dark lines separate the cells. Collection name in bold sans-serif at the top, spanning the full width. Each small cell has a subtle item label.
Creative hook: The grid layout mimics a curated lookbook or catalog page. The size hierarchy (one large, several small) creates visual interest. Grid lines are thin and precise. Small "Shop Now" text with an arrow in the bottom-right cell.
Mood: Curated, editorial, catalog, organized.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Grid lines become gold. Off-white shifts to warm cream. Add "تشكيلة رمضان" as the collection name. Small crescent icon in one cell corner.`,
      eid: `Grid lines stay dark. Add gold corner accents on each cell. "تشكيلة العيد" as the collection name.`,

The diagonal line is sharp and clean. Headline text in white, rotated to follow the diagonal angle. Small brand badge at one corner.
Creative hook: The diagonal slash is aggressive and modern — it breaks the expected rectangular grid. The rotated text following the angle creates kinetic energy. The color block is pure and undecorated. Single strong color + product image = maximum impact.
Mood: Bold, modern, angular, streetwear-meets-high-fashion.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Color block becomes deep navy or forest green. Add a thin gold line along the diagonal cut. Small crescent shape at the triangle peak.`,
      eid: `Color block becomes warm gold. Diagonal edge gets a subtle sparkle texture. Dynamic festive energy.`,

  {
    id: "fa-price-slash",
    name: "Bold Price Slash Discount",
    category: "fashion",
    directive: `Concept: Split background — rich burgundy or wine red on top, white on bottom. A massive diagonal "slash" graphic element (thick line or ribbon) cuts across the center with the discount percentage inside it. Original price struck through above, sale price bold below. Product positioned to one side with attitude.
Creative hook: The slash graphic is both literal (price slash) and visual (cutting through the layout). The diagonal creates tension and urgency. Burgundy communicates premium while red energy drives the sale message. Bold condensed typography for the prices.
Mood: Sale urgency, premium discount, bold, fashion-forward.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Burgundy becomes deep navy. Slash becomes gold. Add "عروض رمضان" in the slash ribbon. Elegant sale, not aggressive.`,
      eid: `Burgundy stays. Gold sparkle accents around the slash. "تخفيضات العيد" label. Festive urgency.`,
    },

    id: "fa-neutral-elegance",

Headline in dark charcoal with elegant spacing. A thin golden rule line below the headline. Social media icons in a tiny row at the very bottom.
Creative hook: The overlapping neutral rectangles create a collage/mood-board aesthetic common in fashion branding. The golden rule line is the only metallic accent — it signals quality without shouting. Earth-tone sophistication throughout.
Mood: Earthy, sophisticated, neutral, editorial.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Neutral tones deepen slightly. Golden rule line becomes more prominent. Add a subtle crescent shape in one of the overlapping blocks at low opacity.`,
      eid: `Warm gold replaces the taupe block. Small golden sparkle dots at block corners. Subtle festive warmth.`,
    },

    id: "fa-street-bold",
    name: "Street Fashion Bold Typography",
    category: "fashion",
    directive: `Concept: High-contrast black and white base with one punchy accent color (electric yellow, neon green, or hot pink). Massive bold headline in the accent color, taking up nearly half the canvas. Product below in a raw, unpolished composition — slightly rotated or off-grid. Grungy texture overlay at very low opacity. Small text details scattered intentionally "messy."
Creative hook: The oversized colored text on black creates streetwear poster energy. The slightly off-grid product placement feels rebellious and intentional. The grunge texture (noise/grain dots) adds underground authenticity. One accent color only — discipline within chaos.
Mood: Street, urban, rebellious, bold, youthful.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Accent color becomes gold on deep navy. Tone shifts from rebellious to "cool premium." Small crescent integrated into the typography. Grunge texture replaced with subtle geometric pattern.`,
      eid: `Accent color stays bold. Add gold starburst shapes mixed into the composition. "عيد" in massive accent-colored text as part of the headline.`,

    id: "be-soft-glow",
    name: "Soft Pink Glow",
    category: "beauty",
    directive: `Concept: Warm rose-pink gradient background with multiple bokeh circles of varying sizes in lighter pink and white, creating a dreamy glow effect. Product centered with a soft white halo glow around it. Headline in white with delicate letter-spacing. Small rose-gold CTA pill at the bottom.
Creative hook: The bokeh circles create a "soft focus" beauty photography feel entirely through CSS gradients. The white halo around the product makes it feel luminous and precious. Overall effect is like looking through a soft-focus lens. Very light, airy, and feminine.
Mood: Dreamy, soft, feminine, radiant, spa-like.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Pink shifts to warm champagne/gold. Bokeh circles become golden. Add a small crescent shape among the bokeh. Text becomes deep brown with gold accents.`,
      eid: `Pink stays but gets warmer. Bokeh circles gain gold tints. Small sparkle stars mixed with the circles. Celebratory glow.`,

    id: "be-gold-shimmer",
    name: "Gold Shimmer Premium",
    category: "beauty",
    directive: `Concept: Rich warm gradient from deep bronze at the edges to bright gold at the center, creating a metallic shimmer effect. Product floating at center with a subtle reflection below it. Headline in white with a thin gold underline. Small diamond-shaped decorative elements scattered sparingly. Price in a translucent dark pill.
Creative hook: The bronze-to-gold gradient creates a liquid metal shimmer feel. The product reflection suggests a polished surface. Diamond shapes (CSS rotated squares) add sparkle without clutter. The entire poster feels like a luxury cosmetics counter.
Mood: Luxurious, golden, premium, cosmetics-counter quality.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Gold deepens to amber-to-navy gradient. Diamond shapes become crescent-and-star motifs. "عروض رمضان" in elegant white script.`,
      eid: `Gold becomes brighter and warmer. More diamond sparkle shapes. "عيد مبارك" in prominent gold-on-dark text.`,
    },
  },
  {
    id: "be-before-after",
    name: "Before/After Comparison",
    category: "beauty",
    directive: `Concept: Clean horizontal split — left side slightly desaturated/muted with "قبل" (before) label, right side vibrant and glowing with "بعد" (after) label. A thin vertical line or gradient transition separates them. Product placed at the boundary, bridging both sides. Bold headline at top, results-focused subtitle below.
Creative hook: The before/after split is the most powerful visual metaphor in beauty marketing. The desaturation-to-vibrance transition tells the story instantly. The product at the boundary is the "bridge" — the solution. Clean typography keeps focus on the transformation.
Mood: Transformative, results-driven, clean, convincing.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `"After" side shifts to warm golden tones. Add a small crescent icon near the headline. Transition line becomes gold. "عروض رمضان" badge at top.`,
      eid: `"After" side gets warm festive glow. Small sparkle accents on the vibrant side. "عروض العيد" label. Celebratory transformation.`,

    name: "Pastel Card with Rounded Elements",
    category: "beauty",
    directive: `Concept: Soft lavender or mint green background with a large white rounded-corner card centered on the canvas. Product image inside the card with generous padding. Rounded pill-shaped elements for price and CTA in pastel accent colors. Small circular dots in coordinating pastels scattered around the card exterior. Headline above the card in dark text.
Creative hook: The rounded card with rounded pills and circular dots creates an entirely "soft" visual language — no sharp corners anywhere. This softness is inherently beauty/skincare-coded. The pastel palette feels fresh and clean. The card creates a "product spotlight" effect.
Mood: Fresh, soft, playful, skincare-clean.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Lavender becomes warm cream. Card border gets a thin gold line. Pastel pills become gold-tinted. Small crescent shape among the scattered dots.`,
      eid: `Pastels become warmer. Scattered dots gain gold accents. Card gets a subtle gold shimmer border. Festive softness.`,
    },
  },
  {
    id: "be-luxury-dark",
    name: "Dark Beauty Luxury",
    category: "beauty",
    directive: `Concept: Deep matte black background with the product dramatically lit from one side, creating a strong light-to-shadow gradient across its surface. Headline in thin, elegant white serif typography with extreme letter-spacing. A single accent color — deep berry, wine red, or mauve — used for the CTA and one decorative line. Subtle particle dots in white at very low opacity suggesting shimmer.
Creative hook: The dramatic side-lighting creates high-end beauty campaign energy. The extreme letter-spacing on thin serif text whispers luxury. The single accent color is used with surgical precision — only where it matters. Black negative space dominates.
Mood: High-end beauty, dramatic, editorial, luxurious.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Accent color becomes gold. Add a faint Islamic star pattern in gold at extremely low opacity. "رمضان" in thin gold serif. Premium spiritual mood.`,

    name: "Floral Decorative Frame",
    category: "beauty",
    directive: `Concept: Warm off-white or pale pink canvas with an ornate floral/botanical frame border created from CSS shapes — circles for petals, curved lines for stems, small dots for buds. The frame is in soft rose-gold or dusty pink. Product centered within the frame. Headline in elegant script-style placement above the product, inside the frame boundary.
Creative hook: The floral frame transforms the poster into a perfume box or luxury skincare packaging aesthetic. The botanical elements are abstract and geometric — not realistic flowers, but the suggestion of them through circles, arcs, and dots. The frame contains and elevates everything inside it.
Mood: Botanical, elegant, packaging-quality, feminine.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Floral frame becomes gold on cream background. Add small crescent shapes woven into the botanical elements. "رمضان كريم" in the frame header area.`,
      eid: `Frame becomes warm gold with green leaf accents. Small sparkle dots among the floral elements. "عيد مبارك" integrated into the frame top.`,

    id: "be-clean-spa",
    name: "Clean Spa Minimal",
    category: "beauty",
    directive: `Concept: Pure white canvas with a single horizontal band of soft sage green or seafoam across the middle third. Product placed on the green band with a subtle shadow. Headline above in dark charcoal, description below in light gray. A thin sage-green line above and below the band. Small leaf or water-drop shape as the only decorative element.
Creative hook: The horizontal color band creates a "shelf" for the product — like a spa display. The sage green communicates natural, clean, wellness. Extreme whitespace above and below the band creates breathing room. The single leaf/drop shape is the brand's nature signal.
Mood: Spa, clean, natural, wellness, serene.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Green band becomes warm gold/sand. Add a small crescent shape replacing the leaf. Headline in warm dark brown. "عروض رمضان" in refined small text.`,
      eid: `Green band gets a subtle gold gradient edge. Leaf shape becomes a sparkle. Small gold dots along the band edges. Quiet celebration.`,
    },
  },
  {
    id: "be-gradient-dream",
    name: "Dreamy Gradient with Soft Overlays",
    category: "beauty",
    directive: `Concept: Full-bleed gradient flowing from soft peach at top-left to lavender at bottom-right, creating a sunset-dream effect. Large semi-transparent white overlay shapes (circles and blobs) at low opacity scattered across the gradient, creating a layered, dreamy depth. Product in the center with a soft white glow. Headline in white with a subtle text-shadow for legibility. Small translucent CTA pill.
Creative hook: The peach-to-lavender gradient is inherently beauty-coded — it evokes skincare, makeup palettes, and feminine wellness. The translucent white overlays create depth like layers of silk or petals. Everything feels soft, diffused, and dreamlike. No hard edges anywhere.
Mood: Dreamy, ethereal, soft, beauty-forward, fantasy.`,
    campaignModifiers: {
      ramadan: `Gradient shifts to warm cream-to-gold. White overlays become gold-tinted. Add a crescent shape as one of the floating overlay elements. Warm spiritual dreaminess.`,
      eid: `Gradient becomes peach-to-warm-gold. Overlay shapes gain sparkle edges. Small starburst shapes mixed with the blobs. Festive dream.`,
